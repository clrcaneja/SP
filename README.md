Only draft test runs for my network simulations

Network test file contains the completed running code for network SEIR simulations. SIR version has been included only for cross-checking with reference if code works. Bottom part is miscellaneous tests.

Phi test is ongoing file to solve for \Phi and code for network ODE. Have not yet figured out how to save the network per iteration of the simulation since package automatically trashes the network.
